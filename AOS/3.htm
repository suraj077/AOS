	<h2 style="color: Tomato;">Hearing vs. Listening:</h2>

	<p>Do you think there is a difference between hearing and listening? You are right, there is! Hearing is simply the act of perceiving sound by the ear. If you are not hearing-impaired, hearing simply happens. Listening, however, is something you consciously choose to do. Listening requires concentration so that your brain processes meaning from words and sentences. Listening leads to learning.</p>
	<h2 style="color: Tomato;">Task of listening can be of two kind:</h2>

	<ul><li><strong>Extensive Listening</strong></li>
	    <li><strong>Intensive Listening</strong></li></ul>
	    

<p><strong style="color: Tomato;">Extensive Listening</strong> Here as a listener you listen to a lengthy story, radio programme or an anecdote. The listening material may be lengthy. As a learner you listen for pleasure and there is no need to complete a worksheet or a task. It may take place inside or outside the classroom.</p>
<p><strong style="color: Tomato;">Intensive Listening</strong> Here as a learner you need to listen very carefully. For example, when you listen for directions you listen carefully and with full concentration. Such material is short and has a special task or worksheet designed on it. There is some of challenge so that the learner feels motivated to complete the task. As you complete the task you get practice in specific listening skills.</p>

<h2 style="color: Tomato;">A Good Listener:</h2>

<p><ul>
	<li>looks at the speaker and makes <strong style="color: Tomato;">Eye Contact</strong></li>
	<li>does not finish the other person's sentences. There is nothing more irritating then trying to express an original thought when someone cuts in and assumes the rest of the statement.</li>
	<li>uses <strong style="color: Tomato;">positive body language</strong></li>
	<li>uses <strong style="color: Tomato;">positive verbal signals</strong>. Says <q>u-huh</q> or <q>hmmm</q> or <q>I understand</q>.</li>
	<li>uses <strong style="color: Tomato;">positive facial expressions</strong>. Smiles often, even when on the telephone;</li>
	<li>asks good questions to prompt further discussion snd develops questions from the other person's responses. To do this effectively, the listener must be attentive.</li>
	<li>focuses on what the speaker is saying and not on his/her own next statement.</li>
	<li>exhibits patience.</li>
	<li>does the 80-20 rule. Simply stated, you speak 20 percent of the time and listen 80 percent of the time.</li>
</ul></p>
